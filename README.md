## Business Model
**Affiliate Links**: 
By incorporating affiliate links for flights, trains, and hotels, the Multilingual AI Trip Planner can generate revenue by earning a commission of 5% on the total cost of bookings made through these links. This model leverages partnerships with travel providers to monetize user bookings while providing a seamless booking experience for users.

**Guide Option**:
Offering guide services for historical monuments, museums, and other tourist attractions presents an opportunity to generate revenue. The platform can provide users with the option to hire local guides for personalized tours at specific destinations. By facilitating guide bookings, the platform can charge a commission of 10% on the fees paid by users to the guides. This model taps into the unorganized market of guide services and adds value to users by enhancing their travel experiences with expert guidance.

**Sponsored Content**: 
Offer sponsored content opportunities to travel-related businesses, such as airlines, hotels, and tour operators, to promote their services or destinations within the BharatBhraman platform.

**AdSense Integration**: 
Implement Google AdSense within BharatBhraman to display targeted advertisements to users based on their trip planning activities and preferences. AdSense can generate revenue through pay-per-click (PPC) or cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) models.
